erc-better-scroll.el
====================

This file improves the scrolling for GNU Emacs ERC IRC client. It was written by Deniz Dogan.

Much elisp is covered by FSF style licensing. Deniz Dogan offered this freely as a patch, and my /guess/ is that it's already covered by the FSF license restrictions, namely the GPL3, that might apply to any code posted to that list. Out of consideration for that, I refer you to the original posting:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2012-06/msg00360.html

This 'patch' completely fixes problems I've had with erc-scrolltobottom-mode.

Thanks to Deniz Dogan.
